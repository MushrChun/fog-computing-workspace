Android devices work on behalf of IoT devices in the implementation.

The aim of android devices is to collect ambient video and upload images in the stream to the Fog Nodes.

Due to weak computing power of IoT devices and constrained power usage, the face detection and face recognition tasks are directed to Fog Nodes.

Fog Nodes are consist of commodity coputers, they try their best to consume requests from IoT devices and overflow partial tasks via a dynamic allocation algorithm.

Cloud Nodes share the same repo with Fog Nodes, however, the deployments of them are different. Cloud Nodes make use of Cloud infrustrucutres and Serverless to flatten the CPU usage.
